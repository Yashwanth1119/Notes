### *void setup()*

The code that you put inside void setup() will run only once and that will be at beginning of the program.

### *void loop()*

In void loop() your code will repeat over and over again, void setup() is the first funcion to be executed, it usually contains statements that set the pin modes on the arduino to output and input.

#### Experiment:-
1. Giving instructions to the LED to turn on for every two seconds after one second.

```
// c++ code
// 
void setup()
{
    pinMode(2,INPUT);
    pinMode(13,OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
    if(digitalRead(2)==1)
    {
    digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
    }
    else
    {
    digitalWrite(13,LOW);
    }
}
```
