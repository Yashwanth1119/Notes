lab -> arduino uno -> digital pins, analog pins
lab -> raspiberry pi -> microprocessor micro controller -> mini computer -> programs, portable devices.
### IOT
It is a internet of things which means accessing and controlling daily usuable equipment and devices using internet. IOT includes the ecosystem decision frameworks, architectural and domain biometrics security cameras and door unlock systems and devices. There components has their own individual features to provide better environment.
IOT -> sensors & actuators.
for example:- phone brightness is adjusted based on my GPS location or by direction. The term things inn the IOT refers to anything and everything in the day-to-day life which is accessed or connected through the internet.

Devices for eg:- smartphone, wearable technologies, vehicles, homelight, home apppliances, personal computers.

IOT is an advanced automation is analysis system which deals with AI.

## Characteristics of IOT

### *Connectivity:-*

### *Intelligence & Identity:-* 
The extraction of the knowedge from the generated data. for eg:- sensors generated data but that data only be useful if it is interpreted properly.Each IOT device has unique identity and this identification is useful/helpful in tracking the equipment.

### *Scalability:-*
The no. of elements which are connected to the IOT zone are increasing day-by-day so the IOT setup that should be capable of handling the massive expansion. So the generated data as an outcome is enormous and it should be handled approximately.
sensors -> collect data and converts into electrical signal.
actuators -> converts electrical signal into motion.

### *Sensors:-*
It is a device used for conversion of physical events into the electrical signals, & this is a hardware devices that takes the input from is a hardware devices that takes the input from environment and gives to the system by converting it.
eg:- GPS, thermometer.

### *Actuators:-*
It converts the electrical signals intho the physical events. It takes the input from the system and gives output to the environment.
eg:- motors, heaters, gyser.

## Layers of architecture

### *IOT Devices:-*
Devices are the hardwares like sensors, gadgets, appliances they collect the data and exchange data over the internet. They are programmed for certain applications and can be embedded into other IOT devices.
eg:- Arduino Uno -> micro controller
raspiberry pi -> mini computer.

eg:- an IOT device in your car can identify the traffic ahead and sent out message automatically to person you are about to meet.

### *Protocols:-*
Its having some reactions for commands and these protocols are important while in communication devices.
eg:- MQTT(message Q telementary transport protocol)
HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol)

### *Gateways:-*
Gateways are centralised hub that connects to IOT devices and sensors to cloud based computing and data processing
eg:- LAN, wifi, mobile data.

## IOT Embling Technologies

1. Wireless sensor network
2. Cloud computing
3. Big data analytics
4. Communication protocols
5. Embedded systems

### *Wireless sensor network:*
It is a distributed devices with the sensors which are used to monitor the environment & phyiscal condition WSN **cons** of nodes, router's, coordinators. End nodes have several sensors which are attached to them were the data is passed to the coordinator with the help of router.
The coordinator also acts as the gateway that connect wireless sensor network to the internet.
eg:- weather monitoring system, soil moisture **system**, surivallence system, health monitoring system.

### *Cloud Computing:*
It provides as the means by which we can access the applications over the internet with the cloud computing users can access any resources from anywhere. Databases,web servers, storage and any sofeware over the internet
eg:- Heroku, aws, azure

## Services of Cloud computing
### *IAAS:*
Provides online services such as phyiscal & virtual machines servers, networking, storage, and data centered space, on pay per bases. provider of IAAS google compute engine,aws
### *PAAS:*
