# *Network Security threats:-*
Following are diff types of network*
 
### *Computer virus:-*
These are unequally designed piece of code that get distributed through email attachments or pendrives. A virus can divide certain features on your system and can steal important info.

### *Rogue Security Software:-*
These are software programs designed to showcase the role played by an antivirus software, however the actual purpose of this software is different. It is advertised as a program that can remove virus but the actual job of this fake software is to steal user data and it leaves your system in a worse stage moreover the user also pays for purchasing such type of software.

### *Trojan:-*
It is a famous virus which hides behind a piece of software program mostly it spreads through email which is sent from known people it comes in the form of an attachment which is immediately downloaded on your system. It an highjack the webcam and steal account information.

### *Adware spyware:-*
Adware is a piece of the code that can monitor your entire behaviour. The adware that gets downloaded into your system that collect any piece of information which is considered malicious spyware is similiar to adware which focus on stealing information such as credict card number or pwds.

### *Worms:-*
These are malware program having ability to spread from machine to  machine. They can quickly may duplicate copies of their own. It works by accessing the context stored on your system such as email address or a particular webpage.

### *Denial of service(DOS):-*
These are the errors which give a false impression of an overloaded server.
It happens when a group of  users is waiting for some online task such as launch of a product.

### *Rootkit:-*
It is a collection of tools that allow hackers to access your system from a different origin. It allows the hacker to become an administrator of your machine and they can perform malicious operations. They can disable antivirus software on your machine.

### *SQL injection attack:-*
Most companies use SQL to store their data which is vulnerable to SQL injection attack which are data driven and force the companies to provide a layer of security around their data.

### *Man-in-the-middle:-*
In the case a hacker listens to the network conversations and can modify or manipulate the data.

### *Phishing:-*
It is in the form of text, email or in the requesting form and pretend like a genuine request but it will trick the receiver to open a link or an attachment which can install malware on your system.

# *Network Attacks*
It is an attack to gain unauthorized access to an organization networks with the objective of stealing data of performing any other malicious activity. there are two types of attacks.
1. Passive attack: In which the attackers can gain access to a network and can monitor or steal sensitive info without making any changes to the data.
2. Active attack: In which the attackers not only gain unauthorized access but also modify data bu deleting encrypting or harming it.

## *Examples of network attack*
1.Unauthorized Access: It refers to the attackers accessing a network without receiving permission major causes of unauthorized access are:-
(1) weak pwds
(2) Shared accounts

2. Distributed Denial of Service(D-DOS) attack: The attackers try to build a  botnet of various devices abd use them to forward false traffic to your network.
 The D-DOS attack can occur at the network level which creates a bottle neck in the network and denies services to the network users as the network is flooded with huge volume of false network packets.
3. Man-in-the-middle attacks: It attackers who try to intercept the network traffic between you network and external sites or within your network. If the network is not using a secure communication protocol attackers can easily intercept and steal the data that is transmitted and even highjack the network session.
4. Insider Threats: A network is also affected by malicious inside users who already have access to the network. It is difficult to detect and protect against inside threats. New technology known as UEBA (user even behaviour analytics) can help to identfy suspicious behaviour by internal users.
5. Priviledge escalation: Once the attackers penetrate in your network they can use priviledge escalation to expand their reach. Horizontal priviledge escalation involves attackers gaining access to additional adjacent system and vertical escalation means attackers can gain a high level of priviledge for the same system.
6. Code attack: Many websites accepts user input but fail to validate those inputs

The attackers can fill out a form by passing malicious code instead of expected data values that code is executed  of the server and allows attackers to gain access to server.

# *Security Services:*
* Authentication--encliperment, digitak signature,authentication  exchange
* Access control--access control mechanism
* Availability--access control, authentication exchange
* Confidentialy--enclipherment, routing control
* Integrity--enclipherment, data integrity check, digital signature
* Non-reputation--digital signature, data integrity check.

*Some of the basic network services that we use includes:*

1. Directory services:- which provides mapping between name and value and helps to store the info in an organised manner in which , it is easy to access. It is mostly used to maintain info of user account, in which user name are mapped to user pwds. The user account can be organised in a hierarchical structure and can be used to verify user account at the time of login, user credenticals are, mapped to user name similarily, a directory service also maps an IP address to corresponding domain name to access a web page.

2. File service:- It include sharing and *triangle occuring* files over the network users can upload a file which is accessible to all users or provided access to intended users per reading the file on its own computer, users can also copy or move files from one system to another
3. Application Services:- These are concerned with providing web services to connect to internet and access info on the internet. They also provide database managing and resource sharing.
eg:- sharing a printer or scanner on network.

4. Communication services:- These include using mail services or social media and discussion forums which enable the users to put questions or suggestions which can be seen and answered by all other users. The users can also access data residing on a remote computer by using remote desktop access.

### **Security services:**
Having identify various network services will need to apply security services & mechanisms to prevent them from network threats & attacks, different security services includes-

1. Authentication: It can sure that the given message is from original sender the corresponding security mechanism which applies includes enclipherment, digital signature & authentication exchanges.
2. Access Control: Which manage to grant to access rights to particular users, access right may include reading, writing or modifying the corressponding security mechanism is access control system.
3. Availability: It should be available to authorise person per 24 hrs of the week. The security mechanism used at backends are access control and authentication exchange.
4. Confidentiality: It means the info is not made available to unauthorised person outside the organisation network. The security mechanism at the backend include encliperment and routing control.
5. Integrity: It means to ensure that the message is unaltered, the security mechanism to ensure this inlcude enclipherment, data integrity check & digital signature.
6. Non-repodiation: It means protection against denial of sending or receving during communication it is ensured by digital signature & data integrity check.
